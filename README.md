# Uber-Demand-Supply-Forecasting-with-AI
This project involves building an AI-based model that predicts the gap between the supply and demand of ride-hailing services in a city, based on data collected over a period of time. The aim is to help Uber or other ride-hailing companies maximize the utilization of their drivers, and provide a reliable service to their customers.
